        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>We are a local Long Island based coffee company, who's been in business for 4 months ! We take pride in recycling,
        so we make sure to always re-use our coffee filters! We even go as far as to not wash 50%
        of our mugs. This is so we don't waste water, plus we could never offer our fan favorite
        $1 seasoned mug special! We take pride in receiving a C- grade from the health inspector! Much better
        than previous years!</p>
