        <h1>Terrible Coffee Co.</h1>
        <p>Proudly serving some of the worst coffee on eastern Long Island since 1901!
        Started by Gus Coffeeman, who relentlessly pursued his dreams of serving his community a
        hot cup of joe. Gus suffered from defective taste bud disorder, so he never really knew how
        bad his coffee truly was. One proud customer was quoted with saying "Drinking this coffee was the second
        worst mistake of my life, the first was getting married.". We truly don't know how we're still in business
        after multiple failed inspection, but as long as theres coffee we will unfortunately be in business.</p>
