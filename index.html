            <p>Proudly serving some of the worst coffee on eastern Long Island since 1901! Started by Gus Coffeeman, who relentlessly pursued his dream of serving his community a hot cup of joe. Gus suffered from defective taste bud disorder, so he never really knew how bad his coffee truly was. One proud customer was quoted with saying "Drinking this coffee was the second worst mistake of my life, the first was getting married.". We truly don't know how we're still in business after multiple failed inspection, but as long as there's coffee we will unfortunately be in business.</p>
